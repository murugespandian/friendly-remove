# friendly-remove

A simple bash script which overrides the "rm" command in linux. In this prototype, we are just overriding the "/usr/bin/rm" command in  the bash script using  "alias" command. We are temporarly maintaining the deleted files in our custom ~/.RM-Trash directory. You can restore those deleted files from this directory within a day. Dont worry,that directory wont grow bigger. In every midnight,your system will run cronjobs to deleted the trashed files in RM-Trash directory.


USAGE

1. rm filename or directory or wildcard(*), to remove the file which is going to be stored in ~/.RM-Trash directory.
2. rmf filename or directory or wildcard(*), to permenently delete the files.
3. undo, to restore the lastly trashed(using the command rm) files or directory or both.


PS: If you want to change the cronjobs time limit change the entry in cronjobs by executing the below command "crontab -e".
